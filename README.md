# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
Getting and Cleaning Data Course - Final Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

The data used for the purpose of this project represent data collected from the accelerometers and gyroscopes from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. 

An R script called run_analysis.R was created to do the following:
1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

A full description of the data collected is available at the site where the data was obtained:
